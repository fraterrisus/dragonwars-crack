# Board Events

The third byte of map square data includes a "special" identifier. Every time you step on a square the game checks the ID, and if it's non-zero, it runs a block of code (hereafter an "event") that corresponds to that ID. This happens when you "start a turn" on a square, no matter how you got there; it's not tied to movement. Multiple squares on a map can have the same special ID. 

Events can also be triggered by (U)sing an item, skill, or attribute (hereafter an "action"). Usually you have to Use the right thing on the right square (i.e. a square with a particular Special ID), but there are some catch-all Actions that run if you do an unexpected thing.

For instance, in the Slave Camp, the square (04,02) is tagged with Special ID 0x11. When you step on that square, the game runs Event 0x11 `[0969]`, which checks to see if you've noticed the Nature Axe yet. But if you're standing on that square and you Use *Forest Lore*, it runs Event 0x13 `[0975]` instead. That prints some color text and sets a flag that says "yup, you found the Nature Axe". Now, the next time you run Event 0x11 (which is immediately afterwards, because you're still standing on that square), the game shows you the cache that contains the Nature Axe and lets you take it.

There's also a default handler that runs every time you step on every square. This is technically Event 0x00 (although there's a pointer between Event 0x00 and 0x01, it's complicated), but I've listed it last because Markdown's Ordered List tag starts at 1 whether I want it to or not.

Everything seems to run instruction `73`, `mov h[3e] <- h[3f]`. Heap `[3e]` and `[3f]` seem to be something like "the last special event ID"; see `{cs:44bb}`.

I wonder if there's a difference between flags in the 90's and flags in the b0's. Like maybe one gets persisted when you leave the board, and one doesn't? Might need to revisit chunk `0x00`. Offsets from `b9` get reused across boards.

## 0x00 Dilmun

### Flags

- **Random encounters:** no.
- **Create Wall** is forbidden.
- The map **wraps**, which is pretty funny since you can't actually travel over the water.

40. `[1517]` (29,27) The town healer ($4/hp). Run routine at `{11:0000}`.

    > When you pay for healing, the game automatically pools your gold with the first PC. This shouldn't be a problem, unlike in some games where the max gold per PC is ridiculously low.

41. `[1653]` (23,02) Magic refresh pool. Non-dead characters have their Power restored to max.

42. `[1684]` Default handler. If party is outside the rectangle (0,0)-(33,33), ask to exit. Otherwise, check if we're outside (roof texture 0) or inside, and if inside, set the random encounter counter (`[0003]`) to `0x64` (1 in 100).
    - North: `(00:0f,05)` â€” *oops*, this really ought to be `(00:0d,05)`.
    - East or South: `(00:0d,02)`. Hilariously, this means you can exit to the east on dry land at (33,33) and wind up on the other side of the bay.
    - West: `(00:0c,04)`

### Events

1. `[0497]` "You see a campfire ahead."
2. `[04ac]` (10,11) The campfire. Read paragraph #63. Health, Stun, and Power are restored to full. Then the event is deleted from this square.
3. `[037c]` (02,05) "You hear someone singing."
4. `[03a9]` (10,06) Gate on `bitsplit(99,02)`. "You hear moans of pain."

7. `[03a1]` (04,13) Display paragraph #88.
8. `[03d2]` (08,07) The sick man. If `bitsplit(99,02)` is set, you can raid his [belongings](#chest) (`bitsplit(b9,02)`). Otherwise, there's a 1 in 20 chance the he attacks you (combat #1). If you kill him, set `bitsplit(99,02)`. If he doesn't attack you, you get color text.
9. `[047e]` You heal the sick man. Gate on `bitsplit(99,02)` to read paragraph #19. Set `bitsplit(99,02)` and `bitsplit(b9,02)`.
10. `[0940]` You used *Lockpick*. The only locked door is in the wizard's house facing the wall of his treasure room at (06,06); we know this because the wall metadata has a special (`heap[26].0x02` is set). Any skill level is sufficient to unlock the door, which overwrites the wall metadata to turn the impassable wall into a regular door.
11. `[04e5]` You appease the camp with *Bureaucracy* (set `bitsplit(99,01)` ).
12. `[0629]` You impress the wizard (set `bitsplit(99,03)`). Unlocks his treasure room door at `[020b]<-0x21`. Set `bitsplit(b9,04)`.
13. `[0589]` (07,05) If you barge into the wizard's house without showing off your magic skills (`bitsplit(99,03)`), he kicks you out.
14. `[0720]` (06,06) Outside the wizard's treasure room. Checks the door texture to see if the door is locked (`0x31`), and if so, tells you.
15. `[0739]` (06,07) The wizard's treasure. If you haven't either killed the guardian `(99,04)` or impressed the wizard `(99,03)`, you have to fight the Spirit Ward (encounter #2); if you win, set `bitsplit(99,04)` to mark your victory and `bitsplit(b9,04)` to get access to the treasure.
16. `[0377]` You stepped in water. (Splash)
17. `[0969]` (04,02) If `bitsplit(b9,01)`, get the Nature Axe.
18. `[0975]` You used *Forest Lore* in the right place. Gate-and-set `bitsplit(99,27)` to notice an axe stuck in a tree. Set `bitsplit(b9,01)`. Clear `heap[3d]` and `[3e]`.
19. `[05fd]` (07,04) The wizard peers at you from within his house, unless you did this already `(99,03)`
20. `[09a6]` (07,07) A [locked chest](#locked) behind the wizard's house (`bitsplit(99,28)`, difficulty 1).

    > This is the same bitsplit as the chest holding the Dwarven Hammer in the Ruins on King's Isle; if you unlock this chest, you lose that one (and vice versa).
21. `[09bd]` (10,02) The [tavern](#tavern). Louie is here.
22. `[0795]` Default handler. If the party is outside (0,0)-(17,16), prompt to exit. N:`(00:11,04)` ES:`(00:11,02)` W:`(00:10,03)`
    - If this is your first time here (`00,b9` is not set), set `00,b9`. If bitsplit `00,99` is set, you already killed everyone. Delete Events #1â€“12, 17, and 19, then exit. If bitsplit `01,99` is set, you're already friends, so exit. If any character has flag `0x40` (swam out of Purgatory), read paragraph #16; the camp is happy with you. Set `01,99` and exit. Otherwise, the residents are suspicious; exit (and await player action)
    - If you've been here before and either bitsplit `01,99` or `00,99` are set, exit. Otherwise, if you stay on the perimeter of the map, the residents wait for you to leave. If you step inside (1,1)-(13,15), the camp residents attack (encounter #0). If you kill them, read paragraph #18 (shame) and set `00,99`.

3. `[0123]` (04,02) You show your Citizenship Papers to the guard. If `bitsplit(b9,00)` is not set, the guard demands a bribe of $10 per party member. If you pay it, set `bitsplit(b9,00)` and `(b9,01)`.
4. `[023f]` (04,05) If `bitsplit(b9,00)` is set, exit. If `bitsplit(b9,01)` is set, run event #2 instead. Otherwise, the guard asks if you know where you're going; if you say yes, set `bitsplit(b9,01)` and run event #2, otherwise run away.
5. `[02ff]` (04,05) You show your Citizenship Papers to the guard. Set `bitsplit(b9,00)` and `(b9,01)`.
6. `[0383]` Crossing the bridge. If you've already dealt with the guards (`bitsplit(b9,00)` is set), read paragraph #13; there's a 1:10 chance of an encounter with a bunch of Rats (#01). Otherwise, you have to fight the guards (#00). If you win, set `bitsplit(b9,00)`. If you lose, you're kicked off the bridge, to (04,00) or (04,07) depending on which half of the bridge you're currently on.
7. `[0484]` (07,02) A [chest](#chest) (`bitsplit(b9,04)`). You only get one shot at it (`bitsplit(99,2c)`).
8. `[03c3]` (03,01) Color text `{49:03c9}` about Lanac'toor's statue. Erase this event.
9. `[0435]` Default handler. If the party is inside (0,0)-(7,7), gate-and-set `bitsplit(b9,02)` to read paragraph #12. Otherwise, prompt to exit; if the party is in the bottom half of the map (Y coordinate < 4) exit to `(00,12,06)`, else `(00,12,08)`.

### Events

1. ` [0112]` On the bridge. Color text `{4d:0113}`

2. `[0130]` You stepped in water.

3. `[02d5]` (03,06) N approach to the bridge. If `bitsplit(b9,02)`= 0, color text `{4d:02e1}`. Refuse to obey their laws and you have to fight combat #1 (3 Guards). Agree, or kill the guards, and they let you pass (set `bistsplit(b9,02)`).

   > **Bug?:** This event never gets triggered. If you approach from the N, it's assumed that you've already "sworn fealty" to Lansk. If you're approaching from the S, `bitsplit(b9,02)` is set in the default handler as soon as Y=5. In theory if that check was >5 instead of >=5 it might run Event 3 before the default handler, and you'd actually get this encounter.

4. `[0135]` (03,03) S approach to the bridge. If you've already passed "Customs" (`bitsplit(b9,01)`= 1), exit. Otherwise, color text `{4d:0141}`. If you refuse inspection, run combat #0 (3 Pikemen) *unless* someone in your party has at least two ranks in *Merchant*. If you submit to inspection, they take the greater of $100 or 20% of your gold. If you refuse to pay up (or can't), run combat #0. Regardless of how you end this encounter (except for running away from combat), set `bitsplit(b9,01)`.

   > Of course, no one has two ranks in *Merchant*, because they took that skill out of the Level Up screen.

5. `[0371]` Inside the S building. If you've already killed both sets of sleeping guards (`bitsplit(99,7d)`= 1), exit. If the guards *didn't* wake up (`bitsplit(b9,05)`= 0) and you *didn't* just walk into a wall (`bitsplit(40,01)`= 1), the guards continue to slumber. Color text `{4d:0384}` and exit. Otherwise, run combat #2 (5 Guards). If you lose, color text `{4d:03f3}` and re-run combat #2. If you win, color text `{4d:03ba}` and run combat #3 ("not easy"). Again, if you lose, color text `{4d:03f3}` and re-run combat #3. If you win, set `bitsplit(99,7d)`.

6. `[040c]` (01,03) The chest inside the S building. Follow the same tree as Event #5, but when you exit there, you find the strong box in the corner. If `bitsplit(b9,03)`= 0, it's still locked; otherwise the [chest](#chest) is open.

   > Something about this chest is different. The lock isn't handled with the usual mechanism `longcall(0b:000f)` and uses a local flag `bitsplit(b9,03)`Â instead of a global one `bitsplit(99,??)`,Â which seems to be why you can raid this chest repeatedly.

7. `[0477]` Your lockpick tries to unlock the chest. If it's already open (`bitsplit(b9,03)`= 1), you wake up the guards (run Event #9). If you have *Lockpick* 3 or better, set `bitsplit(b9,03)`; otherwise, you wake up the guards.

8. `[052e]` (04,08) Inside the N building. If `bitsplit(99,7c)`= 1, exit. Gate-and-set `bitsplit(b9,04)` for color text `{4d:0543}` and the official throws you out. If you go in a second time, run encounter #0 (Guards, etc.). If you win, set `bitsplit(b9,08)` and `bitsplit(99,7c)`.

9. `[04e0]` You used something unexpected. Set `bitsplit(b9,05)` to wake up the guards.

10. `[0487]` You use the key to unlock the chest. If it's already open (`bitsplit(b9,03)`= 1), you wake up the guards (run Event #9). Otherwise, drop the key and set `bitsplit(b9,03)`.

11. `[04e7]` You pick a sleeping guard's pocket. If you've already killed both sets of sleeping guards (`bitsplit(99,7d)`= 1). If you already stole the key (`bitsplit(b9,06)`= 1), you wake up the guards (run Event #9). Otherwise, color text `{4d:04f6}`, pick up item #4 (the Key), and set `bitsplit(b9,06)`. (If you didn't have room to pick up the key, don't set the bit.)

12. `[05e1]` (05,06) Erase this event. If you don't have a "defeat traps" spell running (`heap[bf]`= 0), color text `{4d:0x05e8}` and you fall in a pit for 1d8 damage. Otherwise color text `{4d:0x05fb}`.

13. `[0614]` (04,06) Set `bitsplit(b9,07)` to activate the second Armory fight (see Event #14). Then run a [chest](#chest) `(bitsplit(b9,08)`) with several magic items, including the Axe of Kalah.

14. `[064c]` (05,07) If you're on your way *out* (`bitsplit(b9,07)`= 1), run combat #3 ("not easy"). If you win, erase this event.

15. `[065d]` Default handler. If the party is outside (0,0)-(7,8), prompt to exit. If you're in the lower half of the map (Y <= 4), exit to `(00:14,11)`, otherwise `(00:14,13)`.

    Otherwise, gate-and-set `bitsplit(b9,00)` for color text `{4d:06a6}`. If you're in the upper half of the map (Y >= 5), set `bitsplit(b9,02)`, which prevents you from ever needing to swear fealty to Lansk.

10. `[05dc]` (04,13) The Priests of the Mud Toad. If `bitsplit(b9,02)`= 1, you receive the Golden Boots. Otherwise, if `bitsplit(99,56)`= 1, exit. Otherwise, if you've sealed up the leak, read paragraph #113, set `bitsplit(99,56)` and `bitsplit(b9,02)`, and receive the Boots. Otherwise, read paragraph #17 and get the leak quest.

11. `[06af]` (05,12) The mud leak. Color text `{4e:06b0}`.

16. `[0834]` (13,14) If you tried to find Berengaria in Phoebus (`bitsplit(99,38)`= 1), he's here instead; clear `bitsplit(99,38)` and run a "[chest](#chest)" (`bitsplit(b9,05)`) with a bunch of scrolls.

17. `[0667]` You cast *D:Create Wall*. If you've already sealed the leak (`bitsplit(99,56)`= 1), exit. If there's already a wall in the right place (the wall texture > 0), exit. Otherwise, run the normal *Create Wall* handler to update the map state, then color text `{4e:0694}`.

# General Events

The metaprogram for each board often calls out to functions in other chunks. Some of these are common to cities and feature additional data, which is worth explaining.

## Taverns<a name="tavern">

*Opcode:* `58090000 longcall(09,0000)`

The next word is the return address, i.e. where you want the program to resume after the party leaves the tavern.

The next word is a pointer to the tavern's "tagline" string.

The following byte is the number of NPC volunteers in residence, followed by an array of pointers to the NPC data. (In practice there's never more than one NPC per tavern, but there's support in the code for more than one.)

The following byte is the number of rumor strings available from the tavern keeper, followed by an array of string pointers.

The tagline string is (usually, although not necessarily) next, then all of the rumor strings.

NPC data starts with the NPC ID number, then the character's name (unpacked, variable-length), then five bytes for the five primary attributes (STR, DEX, INT, SPR, HP). When you add an NPC to your party, `bitsplit(99,57+ID)` is set.

After the attributes, the next two bytes are the NPC's level.

Beyond that there are a series of offset/value pairs that indicate [character](Character.md) bytes to be updated. (I'm not sure why you couldn't have put the level here instead.) The first byte of the pair is the character data offset (i.e. `0x32` for Sun Magic), and the second is the value (i.e. `01`). This is also how we load spells (bytes `3c` and up). The array of bytes ends with `ff`.

There is a similar second array which contains one-byte pointers into the [secondary map data's](Board Data.md) Items list, indicating the NPC's starting inventory. If bit `0x80` is set, the item is equipped by default.

Finally, after the second array, there's a string that is printed when the NPC joins your party. (There's no pointer for this; it's just 1B after the end of the inventory array.)

## Chests<a name="chest">

*Opcode:* `580b0c00 longcall(0b,000c)`

The next word is the return address.

If the following byte is `0xff`, skip it. Otherwise, read that byte and the one after it and run a bitsplit operation to get a heap index and bit. If that bit is zero, ignore the chest and return immediately. (You'll often find the bit is set just before this routine is called to clear it.) The bit gets cleared, although possibly not until you've taken everything out of the chest.

A tagline string (five-bit packed) follows.

After that is an array of two-byte values. The first byte is an index into the [secondary map data's](Board Data.md) Items list, indicating which items are in the chest, and the second byte is the count. If the count is `0x00`, there are an infinite number of that item in the chest (see the Purgatory Low Magic Shoppe). If the item index is `0x80`, it's a Dragon Stone (hardcoded into chunk `0x0b`). If the item index is `0xfe`, it's gold, and the other byte is the amount (in the Purchase Price format). If the item index is `0xff`, the array terminates.

## Locked Chests<a name="locked">

*Opcode:* `580a0f00 longcall(0a,000f)`

Very similar to unlocked chests above, but not exactly. The first word is still the return address.

The next bit is a bitsplit against `heap[99]`, but if it's `0xff`, skip the check. The bitsplit check determines if the chest has been opened (1) or is still locked (0).

If the chest is locked, the following bit is the lock's difficulty level. (If it's `0xff`, nevermind, the chest is actually unlocked.)  If your *Lockpick* skill is less than the difficulty level, you can't open it. If it's equal, you have a 50% chance of opening the lock. That goes up to 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, and 95% if your skill level is higher than the lock's difficulty. It tops out at 95%, so there's always a chance you might fail, but trying again is free. When (if) you unlock the chest, it sets the heap flag to mark the chest "opened" and sets the lock's difficulty level to 0.

If the chest has been opened but the difficulty level is greater than zero, the chest is invisible to you.

There is no tagline, but there is an item array similar to regular chests.

## Shops<a name="shop">

*Opcode:* `580a0000 longcall(0a,0000)`

The next word is a pointer to the tagline string (five-bit packed).

After that is an array of shop categories, starting with a one-byte item count. Each item contains two pointers; the first points to the category's inventory list, and the second points to the category name (five-bit packed string). If there's only one category, there's no category name (and the second pointer doesn't exist).

The return pointer (place we jump back to after the longcall) is set after that array, so the next thing in the stream is an instruction (usually a `jmp` or `exit` or similar).

The strings follow, starting with the tagline and proceeding through the category names.

The inventory lists are also arrays starting with a one-byte item count. Each item is a single byte which is an index into the [secondary map data's](Board Data.md) Items list, indicating which items are for sale in that category.

## Sailing the Boat<a name="boat">

There are five destinations. You pass in the index of your current location so that one isn't show on the list of choices.

- Pirate's Cove `(0a:01,01)`
- Necropolis `(0e:07,14)`
- Freeport `(11:14,15)`
- Sunken Ruins `(00:39,14)`
- Rustic `(00:29,28)`

Your "parking space" is stored in `heap[bd]`.

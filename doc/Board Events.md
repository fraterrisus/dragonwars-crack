# Board Events

The third byte of map square data includes a "special" identifier. Every time you step on a square the game checks the ID, and if it's non-zero, it runs a block of code (hereafter an "event") that corresponds to that ID. This happens when you "start a turn" on a square, no matter how you got there; it's not tied to movement. Multiple squares on a map can have the same special ID. 

Events can also be triggered by (U)sing an item, skill, or attribute (hereafter an "action"). Usually you have to Use the right thing on the right square (i.e. a square with a particular Special ID), but there are some catch-all Actions that run if you do an unexpected thing.

For instance, in the Slave Camp, the square (04,02) is tagged with Special ID 0x11. When you step on that square, the game runs Event 0x11 `[0969]`, which checks to see if you've noticed the Nature Axe yet. But if you're standing on that square and you Use *Forest Lore*, it runs Event 0x13 `[0975]` instead. That prints some color text and sets a flag that says "yup, you found the Nature Axe". Now, the next time you run Event 0x11 (which is immediately afterwards, because you're still standing on that square), the game shows you the cache that contains the Nature Axe and lets you take it.

There's also a default handler that runs every time you step on every square. This is technically Event 0x00 (although there's a pointer between Event 0x00 and 0x01, it's complicated), but I've listed it last because Markdown's Ordered List tag starts at 1 whether I want it to or not.

Everything seems to run instruction `73`, `mov h[3e] <- h[3f]`. Heap `[3e]` and `[3f]` seem to be something like "the last special event ID"; see `{cs:44bb}`. Occasionally one or both values are set to 0 instead.

## Key

`[99,01]` is a **bitsplit**: it's an index to a bit, starting at the high bit (bit 7) of `heap[99]` and shifting `[01]` places to the right. In this example that refers to bit `0x40` of `[99]`. The phrase "gate-and-set" means to check the bitsplit to see if it's true, and if so, don't do anything else; if it's false, set it and then continue.

`(0a:05,07)` is a **map location**. The first number (in hex) is the board number. The second and third are an (X,Y) coordinate (in decimal) on that map. Coordinates on the current map are usually not printed in monotype, i.e. (05,07).

`{45:0412}` is a **memory location** within an (uncompressed) data chunk.

## 0x00 Dilmun

### Flags

- **Random encounters:** no.
- **Create Wall** is forbidden.
- The map **wraps**, which is pretty funny since you can't actually travel over the water.

41. `[1653]` (23,02) Magic refresh pool. Color text `{47:1654}`. Non-dead characters have their Power restored to max.

42. `[1684]` Default handler. If party is outside the rectangle (0,0)-(33,33), ask to exit. Otherwise, check if we're outside (roof texture 0) or inside, and if inside, set the random encounter counter (`[0003]`) to `0x64` (1 in 100).
    - North: `(00:0f,05)` â€” *oops*, this really ought to be `(00:0d,05)`.
    - East or South: `(00:0d,02)`. Hilariously, this means you can exit to the east on dry land at (33,33) and wind up on the other side of the bay.
    - West: `(00:0c,04)`

### Events

1. ` [0112]` On the bridge. Color text `{4d:0113}`

2. `[0130]` You stepped in water.

3. `[02d5]` (03,06) N approach to the bridge. If `![b9,02]`, color text `{4d:02e1}`. Refuse to obey their laws and you have to fight combat #1 (3 Guards). Agree, or kill the guards, and they let you pass (set `bitsplit[b9,02]`).

   > **Bug?:** This event never gets triggered. If you approach from the N, the default handler sets the flag that says you've already "sworn fealty" to Lansk. If you're approaching from the S, `[b9,02]` is set in the default handler as soon as Y=5. In theory if that check was >5 instead of >=5 it might run Event 3 before the default handler, and you'd actually get this encounter.

4. `[0135]` (03,03) S approach to the bridge. If you've already passed "Customs" `[b9,01]`, exit. Otherwise, color text `{4d:0141}`. If you refuse inspection, run combat #0 (3 Pikemen) *unless* someone in your party has at least two ranks in *Merchant*. If you submit to inspection, they take the greater of $100 or 20% of your gold. If you refuse to pay up (or can't), run combat #0. Regardless of how you end this encounter (except for running away from combat), set `[b9,01]`.

   > Of course, no one has two ranks in *Merchant*, because they took that skill out of the Level Up screen.

5. `[0371]` Inside the S building. If you've already killed both sets of sleeping guards `[99,7d]`, exit. If the guards *didn't* wake up `![b9,05]` and you *didn't* just walk into a wall `!(40,01)`, the guards continue to slumber. Color text `{4d:0384}` and exit. Otherwise, run combat #2 (5 Guards). If you lose, color text `{4d:03f3}` and re-run combat #2. If you win, color text `{4d:03ba}` and run combat #3 ("not easy"). Again, if you lose, color text `{4d:03f3}` and re-run combat #3. If you win, set `[99,7d]`.

6. `[040c]` (01,03) The chest inside the S building. Follow the same tree as Event #5, but when you exit there, you find the strong box in the corner. If `![b9,03]`, it's still locked; otherwise the [chest](#chest) is open.

   > Something about this chest is different. The lock isn't handled with the usual mechanism `longcall(0b:000f)` and uses a local flag `[b9,03]` instead of a global one `(99,??)`, which seems to be why you can raid this chest repeatedly.

7. `[0477]` Your lockpick tries to unlock the chest. If it's already open `[b9,03]`, you wake up the guards (run Event #9). If you have *Lockpick* 3 or better, set `[b9,03]`; otherwise, you wake up the guards.

8. `[052e]` (04,08) Inside the N building. If `[99,7c]`, exit. Gate-and-set `[b9,04]` for color text `{4d:0543}` and the official throws you out. If you go in a second time, run encounter #0 (Guards, etc.). If you win, set `[b9,08]` and `[99,7c]`.

9. `[04e0]` You used something unexpected. Set `[b9,05]` to wake up the guards.

10. `[0487]` You use the key to unlock the chest. If it's already open `[b9,03]`, you wake up the guards (run Event #9). Otherwise, drop the key and set `[b9,03]`.

11. `[04e7]` You pick a sleeping guard's pocket. If you've already killed both sets of sleeping guards `[99,7d]`, exit. If you already stole the key `[b9,06]`, you wake up the guards (run Event #9). Otherwise, color text `{4d:04f6}`, pick up item #4 (the Key), and set `[b9,06]`. (If you didn't have room to pick up the key, don't set the bit.)

12. `[05e1]` (05,06) Erase this event. If you don't have a "defeat traps" spell running (`heap[bf]`= 0), color text `{4d:0x05e8}` and you fall in a pit for 1d8 damage. Otherwise color text `{4d:0x05fb}`.

13. `[0614]` (04,06) Set `[b9,07]` to activate the second Armory fight (see Event #14). Then run a [chest](#chest) (`[b9,08]`) with several magic items, including the Axe of Kalah.

14. `[064c]` (05,07) If you're on your way *out* `[b9,07]`, run combat #3 ("not easy"). If you win, erase this event.

15. `[065d]` Default handler. If the party is outside (0,0)-(7,8), prompt to exit. If you're in the lower half of the map (Y <= 4), exit to `(00:14,11)`, otherwise `(00:14,13)`.

    Otherwise, gate-and-set `[b9,00]` for color text `{4d:06a6}`. If you're in the upper half of the map (Y >= 5), set `[b9,02]`, which prevents you from ever needing to swear fealty to Lansk.

### Events

1. `[03aa]` (13,06) The Souvenir [Shop](#shop). Read paragraph #30.

2. `[03cc]` (07,10) Lanac'toor's statue. Loop over the four part bitsplits and set `heap[41]` accordingly. If all parts are present, offer to travel to `(22:07,09)`. If no parts are present, read paragraph #20. Otherwise, display which parts are still missing.

3. `[0461]` You brought the Stone Hand (`ax:=0x03`) back to Lanac'toor's statue. If this part has been returned already `[99,1a+ax]`, exit. Otherwise, return the part, drop the Stone Hand, set `heap[88]=0` and `heap[41]=0`. Then loop over the four statue part bitsplits and set `heap[41]` accordingly. If there are still missing parts, color text `{4e:0490}` and exit. Otherwise, color text `{4e:04a9}` and earn 500 XP for repairing the statue. Change the decoration texture on this square from `0x04` (broken statue) to `0x05` (repaired statue).

4. `[0452]` ... the Stone Arms (`ax:=0x00`)

10. `[05dc]` (04,13) The Priests of the Mud Toad. If `[b9,02]`, you receive the Golden Boots. Otherwise, if `[99,56]`, exit. Otherwise, if you've sealed up the leak, read paragraph #113, set `[99,56]` and `[b9,02]` and receive the Boots. Otherwise, read paragraph #17 and get the leak quest.

11. `[06af]` (05,12) The mud leak. Color text `{4e:06b0}`.

12. `[06cf]` (02,02) The city militia. Read paragraph #32, then run combat #7 (Crazed Militiamen). If you win, erase this event.

16. `[0834]` (13,14) If you tried to find Berengaria in Phoebus `[99,38]`, he's here instead; clear `[99,38]` and run a "[chest](#chest)" (`[b9,05]`) with a bunch of scrolls.

17. `[0667]` You cast *D:Create Wall*. If you've already sealed the leak `[99,56]`, exit. If there's already a wall in the right place (the wall texture > 0), exit. Otherwise, run the normal *Create Wall* handler to update the map state, then color text `{4e:0694}`.

18. `[0943]` Run a random combat, then erase this event if you win.

19. `[08f4]` Default handler. If the party is outside (0,0)-(16,16), prompt to exit. N:`(00:25,09)` E:`(00:26,08)` S:`(00:25,07)` W:`(00:24,08)`.

    Gate-and-set `[b9,00]` to read paragraph #29. If you've already talked to the priests after sealing the leak `[99,56]`, put a wall there. If `[99,1a-1d]` are all set, update the decoration texture on the statue to `0x05` (repaired statue).

    > Apparently this handler doesn't run when you're first dropped on the map and haven't taken an action yet.

### Events

1. `[0343]` (05,11) Stairs up to Slave Estate `(25:05,12)`

1. `[0352]` (08,08) If you're still a slave `[b9,01]`, guards sneer at you `{59:035a}`. Otherwise, run combat #0 (Guards). If you win, erase this event.

1. `[0395]` (13,04) The garbage pile `{59:0396}` is north of here.

1. `[03c2]` (13,02) and surroundings. This room stinks `{59:03c3}`.

1. `[0716]` (13,05) A garbage pile. If you didn't have any inventory when you came in, color text `{59:071f}`. Otherwise, your discarded inventory is here `{59:0742}`, but you can't pick it up if you're still chained (status `0x2`). The rest of this routine is basically the same as "get loot from chest" except there can be a larger number of items to pick up.

1. `[03dd]` (04,05) Read paragraph #60.

1. `[03e5]` (02,15) A ["chest"](#chest) (`[b9,02]`) with a tin cup.

1. `[040d]` (12,08) A [pile](#chest) (`[b9,03]`) of loose rocks.

1. `[0439]` (07,01) A pile of [debris](#chest) (`[b9,04]`) with a pick handle.

1. `[0462]` (12,12) A feeble little spring `{59:0463}`

1. `[049e]` (03,06) If the old man is dead `[99,36]`, you find his [shoelaces](#chest) (`[b9,05]`). Otherwise, the dying old man begs for water `{59:04a5}`. 

1. `[04d5]` (03,06) You use the Cup on the old man. If he's dead `[99,36]`, exit. If the Cup is empty (item flag `0x0`), he scolds you and asks for water `{59:04e3}`. If the Cup is full (item flag `0x1`), read paragraph #61. He dies `[99,36]` and wills you the laces from his boots `[b9,05]`.

1. `[0483]` (12,12) You fill the Cup `{59:0488}`. Set item flag `0x1` .

1. `[0509]` You use one of the hammer parts. If you have all three parts (Rocks, Laces, Handle), drop them and pick up the Crude Hammer; read paragraph #49. Otherwise, you're still missing something `{59:0558}`.

1. `[058a]` Gate-and-set `![b9,01]` to break your chains `{59:059d}`. Set board flag `0x1` (**purpose unknown**). Drop the Hammer and all the Chains, then clear status bit `0x2` from everyone in the party.

1. `[05ca]` (04,12) If you haven't defeated the guards yet `![99,33]`, they're blocking the exit `{59:05d1}`.

1. `[0600]` (05,12) If you're still wearing chains `[b9,01]`, the guards `{59,0627}` drag you back into the mines (05,06). Otherwise, run combat #3 (Guards and Slave Boss). If you win, read paragraph #62, set `[99,33]`, and erase this event.

1. `[066a]` (04,11) A [locked chest](#locked) (`[99,37]`, difficulty 1)

1. `[089d]` Run combat #0 (Guards). If you win, erase this event.

1. `[08a2]` (03,00) Run combat #1 (Snakes). If you win, erase this event.

1. `[08a7]` (02,03) Run combat #2 (Spiders). If you win, erase this event.

1. `[067d]` Default handler. Gate-and-set `[b9,00]`. Then set `[b9,02]`,`[b9,03]`, and `[b9,04]` to enable access to the Hammer parts. If you somehow got here *without* selling yourself into slavery in Purgatory `![99,35]`, exit. (That literally shouldn't be possible.)

   Set `![99,35]` and `[b9,01]`. Take the party's inventory, unequip it, and move it all to a data area `{59:08b2}`. Give everyone a set of Chains and set status `0x2` (chained). Throw away the party's gold.

1. `[03bd]` (05,01) If you've revived Zaton's spirit `[b9,03]`, there's a [chest](#chest) (`[b9,03]`) with a bunch of druid spells. Otherwise, there's a grave marker `{5d:03f6}`.
1. `[0463]` (07,05) If anyone in the party has *Arcane Lore 1*, you spot `{5d:0471}` a Transportation Nexus and are offered travel to King's Isle `(00:19,23)` or Quag `(00:22,13)`. If you don't have *Arcane Lore*, you're teleported to one of the two destinations randomly.
1. `[0538]` If you're following the tracks `[b9,01]`, turn N and step forward.

1. `[05e4]` (14,05) If you've shed blood on the shrine `[b9,02]`, there's a [chest](#locked) (unlocked) with the Enkidu Totem (item 1); set `![b9,02]`. Otherwise, there's a shrine here `{5d:05eb}`.
1. `[064c]` You used Arcane Lore on the island shrine. Read paragraph #72.
1. `[0655]` You used an item on the island shrine. If it's a weapon (item types `0x3-0xb`, so Maces work but Ammunition doesn't), you shed a drop of blood `{5d:066a}` on the shrine; set `[b9,02]`.
1. `[07be]` (02,13) Read paragraph #6.
1. `[07c6]` (02,15) If `[99,42]` and `[b9,04]`, you find a magical horn (`[b9,04]`). If `![99,42]`, set `[99,42]` and `[b9,04]` and then find the horn. Regardless, there's a statue of Enkidu here `{5d:0804}`.

1. `[06ed]` (11,05) If you're facing E, you hop across the water `{5d:06fc}` to (13,05).
1. `[06f2]` (13,05) If you're facing W, you hop across the water `{5d:06fc}` to (11,05).

1. `[074c]` (11,05),(13,05) Bad spot to go swimming. If you've already defeated the lake guards `[99,44]`, you simply fail `{5d:0796}`. Otherwise set `[b9,05]` which wakes up the guards `{5d:0753}`.
1. `[0b3f]` (14,08) If you already went swimming, you find the [ring](#chest) (`[b9,06]`).
1. `[0b4b]` You go swimming. Gate-and-set `[99,41]` to find a ring `{5d:0b52}` and set `[b9,06]`.

   If you haven't fought Namtar yet `![b9,02]` and *didn't* summon the Dragon Queen `![b9,07]`, you went too far `{61:14cb}`. Run combat #10 (10 Young Dragons, 31 Lizard Warriors, 31 Enforcers, 31 Namtar Guards). The game allows you to Run and/or lose gracefully.

   Namtar #1 is a fight to the death; you can't run, and if you lose, you have to repeat it. Win, and you get a triumphant message `{61:1605}` or `{61:16be}`, and then he stands up `{61:16f9}`.

### Events

1. `[0337]` You stepped in water.
1. `[033c]` (09,12) Color text `{64:033d}`.
1. `[035c]` (08,12),(10,12) If you haven't tracked the stag yet `![b9,01]`, you find animal tracks `{64:0363}`. Otherwise, set `![b9,01]` and run combat #2 (Stag). If you lose, exit. If you win, set `[99,11]`. If `![99,12]`, Jack finds you (paragraph #92). Set `[bb],[ba]` to `(x,y+1)`.

   > `[ba]=0` is a special case that says you've already resolved the Jack story
1. `[03b8]` You used *Forest Lore*, which gives you hint that there's a gamewarden around `{64:03b9}`.
1. `[03e3]` You used *Tracker*, which gives you a hint that there's game near the water `{64:03e4}`.
1. `[041f]` (08,12),(10,12) You used *Hiding* or *Tracker* near the bridge. If you killed the stag already `[99,11]`, nothing happens `{64:045a}`. Otherwise, a stag appears `{64:0426}`; set `[b9,01]`.
1. `[07a7]` You used *Bureaucracy, Forest Lore*, or *Tracker*. If you're on the same square as you were when you met Jack (checks `[bb],[ba]`), he likes you `{64:07b7}` but throws you out anyway `(00:25,26)`.
1. `[0353]` Run random combat. If you win, erase this event.
1. `[049a]` If `![b9,02]` and you have Detect Traps running `[bf]>0`, you find a trap `{64:04a7}`; erase this event. If you don't have Detect Traps running you're caught in a trap `{64:04c2}`; set `[b9,02]` and a counter `[bc]=0x28` to hold you in place `{64:04fa}` for 40 turns. This also sets board flag `0x1` and temporarily sets the wall in front of you to be impassable (wall metadata `0xc0`) so you can spin but not move.

   If `[b9,02]` and you've freed yourself`[b9,03]`, erase this event and clear `[b9,02]` and `[b9,03]`.
1. `[057c]` Use an item to try to free yourself from the snare `[b9,02]`. If it's a weapon (item types `0x3-0xb`), set `[b9,03]` and `{64:0597}`.
1. `[0543]` Use *STR* to try to free yourself from the snare `[b9,02]`. If you have *STR 18*, set `[b9,03`] and `{64:0597}`. Otherwise `{64:0551}`.
1. `[0827]` You used the Signet Ring. If you're on the same square as you were when you met Jack (checks `[bb],[ba]`), read paragraph #74. Jack vanishes `[99,12]` and gives you his bow `[b9,05]`. Write your current coordinates to `{071b,071c}` and set `[ba]=0` so Jack stops bothering you.
1. `[05b3]` (03,03) If Jack has vanished `[99,12]`, no one's home `{64:05c6}`. Otherwise, read paragraph #96 and set `[bb],[ba]` to these coordinates.
1. `[05d8]` Erase this event. If you have Detect Traps running `[bf]>0`, you spot a tripwire `{64:0613}`. Otherwise you ring the bell `{64:05df}`. If you haven't killed the bandits `![99,54]`, run combat #3. If you win, set `[99,54]` and `[b9,06]`.
1. `[0646]` If you haven't killed them yet `![99,54]`, run combat #3 (Bandits that look like Goblins). If you win, set `[99,54]`, read paragraph #91, and open a [chest](#chest) (`[b9,06]`).
1. `[0678]` Default handler. If the party is outside (0,0)-(15,15), prompt to exit. N:`(00:25,28)` E:`(00:26,27)` S:`(00:25,26)`W:`(00:24,27)`

   Gate-and-set `[b9,00]` to read a sign `{64:06ab}`.

   If Jack has given you his bow `[b9,05]` and you're on the square where you met him (checks `{071b,071c}`), you find [his bow](#chest) (`[b9,05]`).

   If `![b9,05]` but the Jack story is resolved `[ba]=0`, exit.

   If `![b9,05]` and `[ba]!=0` and you're *not* on the square where you met Jack (checks `[bb],[ba]`), set `[ba]=0` and run combat #4 (Jack). If you lose, he throws you out `(00:25,26)`. If you win, set `[99,12]` and `[b9,05]` and write your current coordinates to `{071b,071c}`.

   If none of that is true, then Jack is waiting for you to explain yourself `{64:0784}`; display monster `0x32` (Jack).

1. `[016b]` (01,00) Color text `{65:016c}` (can't quite see the door)

1. `[0324]` (Room 1) Color text `{65:0325}` (froze the wall). Travel to `(02,04)`.
1. `[034b]` (Room 2) Read paragraph #141 (second wall of fire)
1. `[037a]` (Room 2) Color text `{65:037b}` (burn through the wall of ice). Travel to `(03,05)`.
1. `[0352]` (Room 2) Color text `{65:0353}` (actually a wall of ice)
1. `[03a3]` (Room 3) Read paragraph #142 (gargoyle)
1. `[03aa]` (03,04) Color text `{65:03b0}` (the gargoyle petrifies you), then `{65:0404}`. You're dumped outside `(04,06)`.
1. `[043d]` (Room 3) Color text `{65:043e}` (invisible). Travel to `(03,02)`.
1. `[046b]` (Room 4) Read paragraph #143 (philistine)
1. `[0472]` (04,01) Set `heap[8a]=0xff` to prevent magic use. Run combat #0 (Philistine), then clear `heap[8a]`. If you lose, color text `{65:04e9}` and you're dumped outside `(04,06)`. If you win, color text `{65:0486}` and travel to `(05,01)`.

   > Note that at this point, the walls around (06,02) are invisible and allow you to walk through them (metadata 22), and the door is visible. Also, I think this is the only place that `h[8a]` is ever used to create an anti-magic field.
1. `[051b]` (Room 5) Read paragraph #144 (granite block)
1. `[0522]` (06,02) Color text `{65:0528}` (smashed to bits), then `{65:0574}`. You're dumped outside `(04,06)`.
1. `[05aa]` (Room 5) Color text `{65:05ab}` (destroyed the block). Travel to `(06,03)`, as below.
1. `[0590]` (Room 5) Color text `{65:0591}` (disarmed the trap). Travel to `(06,03)`. Hide the door S of you (`0x10` instead of `0x20`)
1. `[05e4]` (06,03) Read paragraph #145 (that was novel)
1. `[05f5]` (05,03) Color text `{65:0600}` (Utnapishtim is near).
1. `[05ec]` (06,04) Color text `{65:0600}` (Utnapishtim is near).
1. `[0618]` (05,04) Display monster image `0x35` (Utnapishtim). Fake a combat start screen `{65:062a}` and prompt for Fight/Quickfight/Run. Run works as usual. Fight/Quickfight result in color text `{65:067f}` and you're dumped outside `(04,06)`.
1. `[0695]` (05,06) Read paragraph #146 (you win). Prompt `{65:06a2}` to pick a reward. Color text `{65:06ce}` if you take the Soul Bowl. Then open an unlocked [chest](#locked). Then you're dumped outside `(04,06)`.
1. `[0690]` (06,05) Hide the door S of you; set `[006f]=0x10`. (N wall texture at 06,04, was `0x20`)

   > Wall texture 1 has metadata `0xf0` (impassable); texture 2 has metadata `0x90` (no wall). Because this wall is closed behind you, you have to leave the map entirely and come back in to reset this door if you want to repeat the Exam (say, because you picked the wrong item, or you just really wanted a second Soul Bowl).
1. `[0745]` Default handler. If the party is outside (0,0)-(7,7), prompt to exit. NE:`(00:37,24)` S:`(00:36,23)` W:`(00:35,24)`.

   If you refuse, run combat #0 (Myrolla, Royal Guards). If you lose, you're sent to jail as above. If you win, set `[99,6e]`. You find a letter from Drake `{69:0941}` that he's scribbled all over `{69:0941}`. Turns out you did a dumb `{69:09b5}.`

1. `[01bb]` (04,00) A [locked chest](#locked) (`[99,2b]`, difficulty 1) with some scrolls and cash.
1. `[03fd]` (03,01) Run combat #3 (Adventurers). If you win, erase this event.
1. `[01d7]` Default handler. Test and set `[b9,00]`, then set `[b9,01]`.

# General Events

The metaprogram for each board often calls out to functions in other chunks. Some of these are common to cities and feature additional data, which is worth explaining.

Calls to `random(n)` generate a number from `0` to `n-1`, so if you want 1â€“`n` you just have to add 1.

## Taverns<a name="tavern">

*Opcode:* `58090000 longcall(09,0000)`

The next word is the return address, i.e. where you want the program to resume after the party leaves the tavern.

The next word is a pointer to the tavern's "tagline" string.

The following byte is the number of NPC volunteers in residence, followed by an array of pointers to the NPC data. (In practice there's never more than one NPC per tavern, but there's support in the code for more than one.)

The following byte is the number of rumor strings available from the tavern keeper, followed by an array of string pointers.

The tagline string is (usually, although not necessarily) next, then all of the rumor strings.

NPC data starts with the NPC ID number, then the character's name (unpacked, variable-length), then five bytes for the five primary attributes (STR, DEX, INT, SPR, HP). When you add an NPC to your party, `[99,57+ID]` is set.

After the attributes, the next two bytes are the NPC's level.

Beyond that there are a series of offset/value pairs that indicate [character](Character.md) bytes to be updated. (I'm not sure why you couldn't have put the level here instead.) The first byte of the pair is the character data offset (i.e. `0x32` for Sun Magic), and the second is the value (i.e. `01`). This is also how we load spells (bytes `3c` and up). The array of bytes ends with `ff`.

There is a similar second array which contains one-byte pointers into the [secondary map data's](Board Data.md) Items list, indicating the NPC's starting inventory. If bit `0x80` is set, the item is equipped by default.

Finally, after the second array, there's a string that is printed when the NPC joins your party. (There's no pointer for this; it's just 1B after the end of the inventory array.)

## Chests<a name="chest">

*Opcode:* `580b0c00 longcall(0b,000c)`

The next word is the return address.

If the following byte is `0xff`, skip it. Otherwise, read that byte and the one after it and run a bitsplit operation to get a heap index and bit. If that bit is zero, ignore the chest and return immediately. (You'll often find the bit is set just before this routine is called to clear it.) The bit gets cleared, although possibly not until you've taken everything out of the chest.

A tagline string (five-bit packed) follows.

After that is an array of two-byte values. The first byte is an index into the [secondary map data's](Board Data.md) Items list, indicating which items are in the chest, and the second byte is the count. If the count is `0x00`, there are an infinite number of that item in the chest (see the Purgatory Low Magic Shoppe). If the item index is `0x80`, it's a Dragon Stone (hardcoded into chunk `0x0b`). If the item index is `0xfe`, it's gold, and the other byte is the amount (in the Purchase Price format). If the item index is `0xff`, the array terminates.

## Locked Chests<a name="locked">

*Opcode:* `580a0f00 longcall(0b,000f)`

Very similar to unlocked chests above, but not exactly. The first word is still the return address.

The next byte is a bitsplit against `heap[99]`, but if it's `0xff`, skip the check. The bitsplit check determines if the chest has been opened (1) or is still locked (0).

If the chest is locked, the following byte is the lock's difficulty level. (If it's `0xff`, nevermind, the chest is actually unlocked.) If your *Lockpick* skill is greater than the difficulty level, you open the chest immediately. If it's equal, you have a 95% chance, and if it's lower, you have a decreasing chance depending on how much lower: 90%, 85%, 80%, 75%, 70%, 60%, and 50% if your skill is 7 or more ranks below the difficulty level. In practice, the worst lock has difficulty 5.

When you unlock the chest, it sets the heap flag to mark the chest "opened" and sets the lock's difficulty level to 0.

If the chest has been opened but the difficulty level is greater than zero, the chest is invisible to you.

There is no tagline, but there is an item array similar to regular chests.

## Shops<a name="shop">

*Opcode:* `580a0000 longcall(0a,0000)`

The next word is a pointer to the tagline string (five-bit packed).

After that is an array of shop categories, starting with a one-byte item count. Each item contains two pointers; the first points to the category's inventory list, and the second points to the category name (five-bit packed string). If there's only one category, there's no category name (and the second pointer doesn't exist).

The return pointer (place we jump back to after the longcall) is set after that array, so the next thing in the stream is an instruction (usually a `jmp` or `exit` or similar).

The strings follow, starting with the tagline and proceeding through the category names.

The inventory lists are also arrays starting with a one-byte item count. Each item is a single byte which is an index into the [secondary map data's](Board Data.md) Items list, indicating which items are for sale in that category.

## Sailing the Boat<a name="boat">

There are five destinations. You pass in the index of your current location so that one isn't shown on the list of choices.

Your "parking space" is stored in `heap[bd]`. If you approach a dock that isn't the same as where you left the boat, you can't use the dock. (This is how Ugly drops you at the Necropolis; the parking space is still index 0, Pirate's Cove, so the Necropolis dock, index 1, doesn't work.)

- Pirate's Cove `(0a:01,01)`
- Necropolis `(0e:07,14)`
- Freeport `(11:14,15)`
- Sunken Ruins `(00:39,14)`
- Rustic `(00:29,28)`
